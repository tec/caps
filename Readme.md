CAPS - capacity planner
=======================

A web app for assigning colleagues to projects
----------------------------------------------


Features
--------

The application shows a simple table. Columns are projects, rows are workers. 
The table shows the assignments of workers to projects in days (or hours) per week.
Projects and workers can bee added and renamed. Workloads, availabilities and assignments can be edited.
They are always defined for a specific week of the year and are automatically inherited to the next week(s).

Caps is not a fully fledged capacity planner but enough for my and maybe a few others' needs. 
If you miss a certain feature feel free to open issues or pull requests.

To see a sample installation try https://caps-tec.rhcloud.com 
I'm not regularly making sure it's running there but from time to time I push the latest revision to this domain.

Installation
------------

Caps is a standard rails 3 app.
